* Meet the lidar!
- picture of lidar
- This sensor shines a laser light in circles and measures the return times
  from the pulses to give us a 3D model of our world
- Notice that the lidar has a *rotating* component. This makes them more
  fragile the a sensor like a camera, so *they should be handled with caution*.

* Pointclouds
- We use ROS's PCL package to interface with the LIDAR, and get messages of
  type
  [[http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html][PointCloud2]]
- A pointcloud is a data structure for holding the results found by the
  lidar
- This includes an array of points picked up from the the LIDAR and their 
  cartesian coordinates relative to the LIDAR

* What does a pointcloud look like?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Pull out Jason's LIDAR and run rqt
TODO: A launch file that publishes lidar output? If we don't have one
#+END_NOTES
- Live demo time!

* How do we structure ROS projects?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
      project
            package1
                  src
                        node1a
                        node1b
                        ...
                  CMakeLists.txt
                  package.xml
            package2
                  src

* CMakeLists file
- ROS code is built with a build tool called catkin, which itself sits on top
  of a build tool called CMake
- CMakeLists defines the structure of the package for the compiler, as well
  as linking the executable ROS nodes to the appropriate libraries (OpenCV,
  PCL, etc..)
-  [[https://github.com/RoboJackets/roboracing-software/blob/master/iarrc/CMakeLists.txt][Example
   CMakeLists]] 

* package.xml file
- Defines packages the host computer needs to have installed to run the code
  in the project
- "build_depends" are packages needed to compile the code
- "run_depends" are packages needed by the code at runtime
- Also specifies project maintainer/contact information
- [[https://github.com/RoboJackets/igvc-software/blob/master/gazebo/igvc_control/package.xml][Example
  package.xml]]
