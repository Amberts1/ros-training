* What are we doing today?
- Encoders
- launch files
- Gazebo
    - urdf
- PID

* Encoders
#+BEGIN_NOTES
keep it high level. Do an example of ticks
#+END_NOTES
- used to determine the speed of a spinning wheel
    - measure number of ticks during a time step
- 2 main types
    - optical
    - magnetic

* Optical Encoders
- uses a light and a glass wheel to measure ticks
- Things to watch out for
    - sensitive to dust
    - broken disks
- TODO Picture

* Magnetic Encoders
- uses magnets to measure ticks
- generally low accuracy (lower tick count)
- requires occasional tuning
- TODO pciture

* Launch Files
#+BEGIN_NOTES
mention how it can be more human understandable. Just a shorthand for rosrun
#+END_NOTES
- XML files
- a way to launch multiple ros nodes
- recursive

* Commandline
#+BEGIN_NOTES
make sure to mention tab complete
#+END_NOTES
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
roslaunch [PACKAGE_NAME] FILE_NAME.launch
#+END_SRC

* Why Launch Files
TODO example of rosrun with lots of parameters vs launch file

* Structure
- everything is encompassed in the launch tag
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<launch>
    <!-- here -->
</launch>
#+END_SRC

* Valid Tags
#+BEGIN_NOTES
mention that these are the tags the go under the launch tag
#+END_NOTES
| tag | usage |
|-------+------|
| =node= | launches a node |
| =param= | sets up a parameter for that node|
| =remap= | remap a topic name to something else |
| =rosparam= | enables the use of YAML files for setting lots of parameters |
| =include= | includes and launches other roslaunch files |
| =env= | specify and environment variable |
| =arg= | sets a variable that can be used in the rest of the launch file |
| =group= | allows you to group nodes in a single launch file |

* <node>
| tag | usage |
|-------+------|
| =name= | the name given to that instance of a node |
| =pkg= | the package that the node is in |
| =type= | The package to launch |
| =args= | arguments to pass to node |
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<launch>
    <node name="NODE_NAME" pkg="PKG_NAME" type="NODE_TYPE" .../>

    <node name="NODE_NAME" pkg="PKG_NAME" type="NODE_TYPE">
        <!-- tags local to this node -->
    </node>
</launch>
#+END_SRC

* <param>
| tag | usage |
|-------+------|
| =name= | the name of the parameter |
| =type= | the variable type |
| =value= | the value of the parameter |
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<launch>
    <node name="NODE_NAME" pkg="PKG_NAME" type="NODE_TYPE">
        <param name="PARAM_NAME" type="VAR_TYPE" value="VALUE">
    </node>
</launch>
#+END_SRC

* Substitution arguments
- $(env =ENV_VAR=)
    - will set the value from environment variable
    - will fail if =ENV_VAR= is not set
- $(opentv =ENV_VAR= =default_value=)
    - will set the value from environment variable if set
    - will set default if =ENV_VAR= is not defined
- $(find =PKG_NAME=)
    - used for relative paths to files in packages
- $(arg =ARG_NAME=)
    - will set to =ARG_NAME= if it is defined in file

* Useful Commandline Arguments
| option | effect |
|-------+------|
| =--screen= | force node output to screen |
| =--dump-params= | print parameters in yaml format |
| =--nodes= | prints the nodes launched by this launch file |
| =--args= | prints the command line arguments set in launch file |

* Gazebo
- The simulator used be both RoboRacing and IGVC
- TODO add picture of gazebo logo

* Simulation
#+BEGIN_NOTES
talk about how it crashes. Also that we can simulate friction, mass, etc
#+END_NOTES
- simulators are wonderful
- allow to test code in somewhat real life situations
- not a ROS product
    - interacts with ROS through plugins that publish to topics
    - these plugins are not perfect so it crashes *a lot*

* Package Structure
- =TEAM_NAME_Description=
    - contains the URDF file
- =TEAM_NAME_Control=
    - contains the nodes that control the environment

* URDF
- unified robot description format
- this is what gazebo uses to generate the robot
- XML file format
- defines everything in a 3-dimensional grid

* URDF Components
- <robot> encompassing tag
- made up of things called links

* Links TODO incremental example
#+BEGIN_NOTES
take about what each is and how meshes can be used as geometries. visual is required
#+END_NOTES
- links contain
    - *visual geometry*
    - collision geometry
    - intertial geometry

* Joints
- links can be connected using joints
    - all joints have a parents and a child
- all positions are realtive to its parents
    - tree should have a single root

* TODO I AM ROOT

* Joint Types
| type | usage |
|-------+------|
| =revolute= | rotates on an axis and has rotation limits |
| =continuous= | rotates in an axis and has to limits |
| =fixed= | does not move |
| =floating= | 6 degrees of freedom |

* Useful Commands
- =check_urdf=
