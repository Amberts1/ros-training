*** Ensure you have Virtualization turned on in your BIOS
 - [[http://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/][This]] is a simple guide of how to do this.
 - While this is not 100% necessary, it will make your VM much faster.
 - On a Windows host, you may need to turn off Hyper-V as well.

*** 1. Go to =File->Import Appliance=
      [[file:https://i.imgur.com/keQmMy4.png]]

*** 2. Select the =.box= file you extracted earlier
      [[file:https://i.imgur.com/3S2Pgt3.png]]

*** 3. Increase the Amount of Memory and CPU's
      - Increase the Memory/CPU to your computer's specs. Don't allocate too much memory/cpus!

*** 4. Hit =Import=!

*** Configure Settings of Imported Image
*** 1. Right click your new virtualbox entry, and hit =settings=
*** 2. Increase the Amount of Video RAM, and turn on 3D Acceleration
      - If you do not have virtualization, virtualbox may not allow you to turn on 3D Acceleration

*** 3. Turn *OFF* =Remote Display=
